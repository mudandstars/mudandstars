# Hi there

I'm Paul, a passionate Software Engineer based in Germany. 
</br>



## About Me
I love crafting good systems that make a difference.</br>
A system is good, when it a) works and is b) easy to change. Everything else facilitates these causes.</br>
It makes a difference when it solves painful problems for many.</br>
</br>
